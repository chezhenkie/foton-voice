# AppRun hook: host-first fallback libraries.
#
# Libraries under usr/lib/fallback are ones the bundled WebKitGTK needs but
# that must NOT shadow a host copy when the host has one: the host's own
# libraries link against them (Arch's libmount links libsystemd, and needs
# LIBSYSTEMD_251, newer than the copy the ubuntu-22.04 build host bundles),
# so a bundled copy on LD_LIBRARY_PATH aborts the host library at startup.
# They can't simply be stripped either: a host may not ship them at all, and
# WebKitGTK would then fail to load — non-systemd distributions have no
# libsystemd/libudev, and libgstgl-1.0.so.0 lives in libgstreamer-gl1.0-0,
# which gstreamer1.0-plugins-base does not pull in, so a desktop with no
# WebKit of its own can be missing it entirely.
#
# So for each fallback library, expose our copy only when the host has no
# library of that soname. The symlinks live in a per-user runtime directory
# because the AppImage mount is read-only.
#
# This file is installed into the AppDir by the AppImage slimming step in
# build_appimage.sh and .github/workflows/release.yml, and sourced by AppRun
# before it hands over to the linuxdeploy AppRun, which prepends the AppDir
# library directories to whatever LD_LIBRARY_PATH we export here.
