# FotonVoice Engine Documentation

FotonVoice Engine is a high-performance, privacy-first voice-to-text dictation application and programmable voice input broker. All processing happens 100% on-device with zero telemetry or cloud dependencies.

Global shortcuts are registered with your desktop through the XDG `GlobalShortcuts` portal, so **FotonVoice Engine does not read your keyboard** and needs no permission setup at all. See [Privacy & Security](./privacy.md) for exactly what it can see and how to verify it.

```

**Tech Stack:**
- **Frontend:** Svelte 5 + Tailwind CSS 4 + Vite 5
- **Desktop Shell:** Tauri 2 (Rust + WebView); the dictation overlay is a second `WebviewWindow`, not a separate process
- **Backend:** Rust (Tokio async), 15 specialized workspace crates
- **Speech Recognition:** whisper.cpp (GGUF, CPU/Vulkan/CUDA), Moonshine (ONNX/WebGPU), Parakeet TDT (ONNX), Remote Speech Engine (OpenAI-compatible)
- **Dictation Cleanup:** S1-mini (Qwen3-0.6B) via Vulkan-accelerated `fotonvoice-llm-sidecar` (llama.cpp)
- **Text-to-Speech:** Breeze-TTS-2, Piper, Pocket-TTS, Inflect-Micro-v2, VoxCPM2, eSpeak-NG (with on-demand idle unload)
- **Config:** TOML + JSON, hot-reloadable
