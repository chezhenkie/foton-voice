# API Reference

## Tauri IPC Commands

These are the commands the Svelte frontend (or any Tauri WebView) can call via `invoke()`.

**Source:** `src-tauri/src/commands.rs`

```typescript
import { invoke } from '@tauri-apps/api/core';
```

---

### Status & Recording

#### `get_status() -> StatusPayload`
Returns the current application state.

```typescript
const status = await invoke<StatusPayload>('get_status');
```

```typescript
interface StatusPayload {
  recording: boolean;
  processing: boolean;
  speaking: boolean;
  mcp_recording: boolean;
  audio_ready: boolean;
  word_count: number;
  active_target_id: string;
  active_target_label: string;
}
```

---

#### `start_recording() -> void`
Sets the recording flag to true. The audio pipeline will start capturing.

```typescript
await invoke('start_recording');
```

---

#### `stop_recording() -> void`
Sets the recording flag to false, signaling the audio pipeline to stop.

```typescript
await invoke('stop_recording');
```

---

#### `toggle_recording() -> boolean`
Toggles recording state. Returns the **new** recording state.

```typescript
const nowRecording = await invoke<boolean>('toggle_recording');
```

---

### Configuration

#### `get_config() -> AppConfig`
Returns the full application configuration.

```typescript
const config = await invoke<AppConfig>('get_config');
```

---

#### `save_config(newConfig: AppConfig) -> void`
Persists configuration to `~/.config/fotonvoice-engine/config.json` and emits a `config-changed` event to all windows.

```typescript
await invoke('save_config', { newConfig: myConfig });
```

Note the parameter name is `newConfig` (camelCase), not `config`.

---

### Routing

#### `get_targets() -> OutputTarget[]`
Returns all output commands from `targets.toml`. Named `targets` throughout the API; "Output Commands" is the UI label for the same thing.

```typescript
const targets = await invoke<OutputTarget[]>('get_targets');
```

---

#### `save_targets(targets: OutputTarget[]) -> void`
Writes updated targets to `targets.toml`, updates the in-memory cache, hot-reloads the router, and spawns any new FIFO response pipe listeners.

```typescript
await invoke('save_targets', { targets: myTargets });
```

---

#### `get_bindings() -> HotkeyBinding[]`
Returns all hotkey bindings from `bindings.toml`.

```typescript
const bindings = await invoke<HotkeyBinding[]>('get_bindings');
```

---

#### `save_bindings(bindings: HotkeyBinding[]) -> void`
Writes updated bindings to `bindings.toml` and sends a hot-reload signal to the hotkey listener thread.

```typescript
await invoke('save_bindings', { bindings: myBindings });
```

---

#### `reset_chat_conversation(targetId: string) -> number`
Forgets a `chat` target's stored conversation so the next dictation starts a new thread.
Returns how many messages were discarded. Unknown target ids return `0`.

```typescript
const dropped = await invoke<number>('reset_chat_conversation', { targetId: 'hermes' });
```

---

#### `test_chat_target(target: OutputTarget) -> string`
Probes a `chat` target's `GET /v1/models` endpoint. Resolves with a description of the
reachable endpoint, or rejects with the failure reason. Accepts an unsaved target so the
settings UI can test edits before they are persisted.

```typescript
try {
  const detail = await invoke<string>('test_chat_target', { target: editingTarget });
} catch (e) {
  console.error('Chat endpoint unreachable:', e);
}
```

---

### Setup & First Run

#### `open_setup_wizard() -> void`
Opens the first-run wizard, building its window if it has been closed. A
re-opened wizard starts at step one.

```typescript
await invoke('open_setup_wizard');
```

---

#### `finish_setup_wizard(openSettings: boolean) -> void`
Marks setup complete (`ui.setup_completed = true`), persists the config, and
closes the wizard window. Pass `true` to open Settings afterwards.

```typescript
await invoke('finish_setup_wizard', { openSettings: false });
```

---

#### `get_setup_status() -> SetupStatusPayload`
Everything first-run setup depends on, in one call: how global shortcuts are
being delivered, whether text can be typed into other windows, and whether a
speech model is on disk. The wizard's final screen uses it to report problems
it did not itself cause.

```typescript
interface SetupStatusPayload {
  hotkeys: HotkeyStatusPayload;
  hotkeys_active: boolean;
  model_ready: boolean;
  model_size: string;
  model_auto_downloads: boolean;    // small models fetch themselves in the background
  missing_injection_tool: string | null;
  pkexec_available: boolean;
  manual_package_commands: string;
  is_complete: boolean;
}
```

---

### Updates

#### `check_for_update() -> UpdateCheckPayload`
Asks GitHub for the latest published release and compares it with the running
version. Also resolves which release file matches this installation, so
`install_update` does not have to fetch anything twice.

```typescript
interface UpdateInfo {
  version: string;              // "0.4.0"
  tag: string;                  // "v0.4.0"
  current_version: string;      // the version running now
  notes: string;                // release notes, trimmed for a dialog
  release_url: string;
  asset_name: string | null;    // the file that would be installed
  download_size: number;        // bytes
  can_self_update: boolean;     // false for .deb / source / unwritable installs
  unsupported_reason: string | null;
}

interface UpdateCheckPayload {
  current_version: string;
  update: UpdateInfo | null;    // null when this is the latest release
  skipped: boolean;             // the user pressed "Skip this version" on it
}

const result = await invoke<UpdateCheckPayload>('check_for_update');
```

---

#### `get_pending_update() -> UpdateCheckPayload`
What the last check found, without contacting GitHub. Returns `update: null`
if no check has run yet.

---

#### `install_update() -> void`
Downloads the pending update, verifies it against the SHA-256 digest GitHub
published, replaces the running application file and restarts into it. Emits
`update-progress` while downloading and `update-installed` just before the app
exits; on any failure it emits `update-failed` and leaves the running version
untouched. Rejects if no update is pending, if this installation cannot update
itself, or if an install is already running.

```typescript
await invoke('install_update');
```

---

#### `skip_update_version(version: string) -> void`
Records `updates.skipped_version`, so this release is not raised again. A newer
one still is.

```typescript
await invoke('skip_update_version', { version: '0.4.0' });
```

---

#### `set_update_auto_check(enabled: boolean) -> void`
Turns the launch-time check on or off and persists it (`updates.auto_check`).

---

#### `open_update_window() -> void` / `dismiss_update() -> void`
Opens the update window (building it if needed), and closes it.

---

### Text-to-Speech

#### `speak_text(text: string, voice?: string) -> void`
Queues text for TTS playback.

```typescript
await invoke('speak_text', { text: 'Hello world', voice: 'en-us-lessac-medium' });
```

`voice` is optional - omit to use the configured default.

---

#### `check_voice_downloaded(voiceName: string) -> boolean`
Returns whether a Piper voice pack is available locally.

```typescript
const downloaded = await invoke<boolean>('check_voice_downloaded', {
  voiceName: 'en-us-lessac-medium'
});
```

---

#### `download_voice(voiceName: string) -> void`
Downloads a Piper voice pack from GitHub.

```typescript
await invoke('download_voice', { voiceName: 'en-us-ryan-high' });
```

---

#### `list_pocket_tts_voices(voiceDir: string) -> { id: string; label: string }[]`
Returns the built-in Pocket-TTS voice catalogue merged with any custom `.wav` clips found in `voiceDir` (`""` = default directory). A custom clip named after a built-in voice id overrides that entry's label/source instead of adding a duplicate.

```typescript
const voices = await invoke<{ id: string; label: string }[]>('list_pocket_tts_voices', {
  voiceDir: '',
});
```

---

#### `check_pocket_tts_ready(voice: string, voiceDir: string) -> boolean`
Returns whether the model weights, tokenizer, and the selected voice's reference clip are all present locally (no network access).

```typescript
const ready = await invoke<boolean>('check_pocket_tts_ready', {
  voice: 'alba',
  voiceDir: '',
});
```

---

#### `download_pocket_tts(voice: string, voiceDir: string, hfToken: string | null) -> void`
Downloads the gated model weights, tokenizer, and the selected voice's reference clip. For a custom voice resolved from `voiceDir`, the clip is already on disk so only the model weights/tokenizer are fetched.

```typescript
await invoke('download_pocket_tts', {
  voice: 'alba',
  voiceDir: '',
  hfToken: '<your HuggingFace token>',
});
```

---

#### `inflect_micro_available() -> boolean`
Whether this build was compiled with the `inflect-micro` cargo feature. When `false` the engine can be selected and its model downloaded, but synthesis is unavailable - the Settings panel uses this to explain why Test TTS is disabled.

```typescript
const available = await invoke<boolean>('inflect_micro_available');
```

---

#### `check_inflect_micro_downloaded(modelDir: string) -> boolean`
Whether both ONNX graphs and a usable phoneme table are present in `modelDir` (`""` = default directory). The table is detected by parsing rather than by filename, so this agrees with what synthesis will actually accept.

```typescript
const ready = await invoke<boolean>('check_inflect_micro_downloaded', { modelDir: '' });
```

---

#### `download_inflect_micro(modelDir: string) -> void`
Downloads `duration.onnx`, `decode.onnx`, their accompanying files, and the ordered symbol list. The export's layout is discovered by listing the Hugging Face API, and the symbol list is fetched separately because it is published in a different repository from the graphs. Independent of the `inflect-micro` feature - the model downloads in any build.

```typescript
await invoke('download_inflect_micro', { modelDir: '' });
```

---

#### `inflect_micro_inspect(modelDir: string) -> object`
Reports what the downloaded graphs actually declare: every input and output with its element type and shape, plus the phoneme table's filename and size. Skips the contract check, so it still answers for a model whose signature does *not* match. Requires the `inflect-micro` feature.

```typescript
const signature = await invoke<unknown>('inflect_micro_inspect', { modelDir: '' });
```

---

#### `lux_tts_available() -> boolean`
Whether this build was compiled with the `luxtts` cargo feature. When `false` the engine can be selected, but synthesis is unavailable - the Settings panel uses this to explain why Test TTS is disabled.

```typescript
const available = await invoke<boolean>('lux_tts_available');
```

---

#### `check_lux_tts_downloaded(modelDir: string) -> boolean`
Whether `text_encoder.onnx`, `fm_decoder.onnx`, `vocos.onnx` and `tokens.txt` are all present in `modelDir` (`""` = default directory). LuxTTS has no download lane - the files are placed there manually - so this is the readiness gate.

```typescript
const ready = await invoke<boolean>('check_lux_tts_downloaded', { modelDir: '' });
```

---

#### `check_breeze_tts_2_ready(modelDir: string) -> boolean`
Returns whether Breeze-TTS-2 model weights and tokenizer exist locally.

#### `download_breeze_tts_2(modelDir: string, hfToken: string | null) -> void`
Downloads gated Breeze-TTS-2 model weights from HuggingFace using the provided token.

---

#### `check_vox_cpm_2_ready(modelDir: string) -> boolean`
Returns whether VoxCPM2 model assets (`config.json`, `generation_config.json`, weights) exist locally.

#### `download_vox_cpm_2(modelDir: string, hfToken: string | null) -> void`
Downloads VoxCPM2 model assets from HuggingFace.

---

#### `hf_token_env() -> string | null`
Returns any `HF_TOKEN` exported in the application environment (takes precedence over UI config).

---

### Speech Recognition Models

#### `check_model_downloaded(modelSize: string) -> boolean`
Returns whether a Whisper model GGUF file is present locally.

```typescript
const downloaded = await invoke<boolean>('check_model_downloaded', { modelSize: 'base' });
```

---

#### `download_model(modelSize: string) -> void`
Downloads a Whisper GGUF model.

```typescript
await invoke('download_model', { modelSize: 'small' });
```

Valid sizes: `"tiny"`, `"tiny.en"`, `"base"`, `"base.en"`, `"small"`, `"small.en"`, `"medium"`, `"medium.en"`, `"large-v2"`, `"large-v3"`, `"large-v3-turbo"`

---

#### `download_parakeet_model(modelSize: string) -> void`
Downloads the Parakeet TDT ONNX model files.

---

#### `check_s1_mini_downloaded(modelDir?: string) -> boolean`
Checks whether the S1-mini GGUF model and tokenizer are downloaded locally.

#### `download_s1_mini_model(modelDir?: string) -> void`
Downloads the S1-mini GGUF model (~480 MB) and tokenizer assets for on-device dictation cleanup.

---

#### `test_remote_stt(endpoint: string, apiKey: string | null, model: string, timeoutSecs: number) -> RemoteSttTestResult`
Tests connection to a Remote Speech Engine (OpenAI-compatible `/v1/audio/transcriptions` API) with sample audio, and queries available models.

```typescript
interface RemoteSttTestResult {
  success: boolean;
  message: string;
  latency_ms: number;
  models: string[];
}
```

---

### Audio Monitoring

#### `start_monitoring_audio() -> void`
Enables the monitoring flag so `audio-level` events are emitted for the VU meter.

```typescript
await invoke('start_monitoring_audio');
```

---

#### `stop_monitoring_audio() -> void`
Disables monitoring and stops `audio-level` event streaming.

```typescript
await invoke('stop_monitoring_audio');
```

---

#### `list_audio_devices() -> AudioDeviceInfo[]`
Returns all available input devices.

```typescript
const devices = await invoke<AudioDeviceInfo[]>('list_audio_devices');
```

```typescript
interface AudioDeviceInfo {
  index: number;
  name: string;
}
```

---

### OpenAI API (LLM post-processing)

#### `test_openai(endpoint: string, apiKey: string | null, timeoutSecs: number) -> OpenAiTestResult`
Pings an OpenAI-compatible API server (`GET {endpoint}/v1/models`) and lists
available models. `apiKey` is sent as a `Bearer` token when present; pass `null`
for servers that don't require authentication (e.g. a local server).

> This command was previously named `test_ollama`; the client speaks the OpenAI
> API and works with any compatible server.

```typescript
const result = await invoke<OpenAiTestResult>('test_openai', {
  endpoint: 'http://localhost:11434',
  apiKey: null,
  timeoutSecs: 5
});
```

```typescript
interface OpenAiTestResult {
  success: boolean;
  message: string;
  models: string[];
}
```

---

### Bug Reports

The commands behind Settings -> Bug Report. What a report may contain, and why,
is in [Bug Reports](./bug_reports.md); the enforcement is in the
`fotonvoice-bugreport` crate. None of these run on their own - every one is a
button press.

```typescript
interface UserStatement {
  summary: string;      // one line; becomes the issue title
  description: string;  // what happened, what was expected
  area: string;         // from a fixed list in the UI
  frequency: "always" | "sometimes" | "once";
}
```

#### `bug_report_context() -> BugReportContext`
What the page needs to describe itself: whether this build can submit a report
itself, where the log it quotes lives, the limits, and how many reports have
gone out.

```typescript
interface BugReportContext {
  relay_configured: boolean;   // false -> the page hides Send and offers the rest
  issues_new_url: string;
  support_email: string;
  log_path: string;
  install_id: string;
  limits: {
    cooldown_seconds: number;
    per_day: number;
    per_month: number;
    min_description_chars: number;
    max_description_chars: number;
  };
  submissions_last_day: number;
  submissions_last_month: number;
}
```

#### `preview_bug_report(statement: UserStatement) -> BugReportPreview`
Builds the report and returns it. `markdown` is the literal issue body, not a
summary of it - the page shows exactly this and nothing fuller is ever sent.
Sends nothing.

```typescript
interface BugReportPreview {
  markdown: string;
  title: string;
  fingerprint: string;
  blocked_reason: string | null;  // why the limits will not allow a send
  can_submit: boolean;
  github_url: string;             // GitHub's new-issue form, prefilled
  mailto_url: string;
}
```

The machine facts are gathered once per run and cached: collecting them shells
out to a system probe (PowerShell on Windows), and the page previews on every
pause in typing.

#### `submit_bug_report(statement: UserStatement) -> BugReportOutcome`
Posts the report to the relay compiled into this build. Re-checks the limits
first - the page may have been open since before the last submission - and
records a submission only when one actually goes out, so a failed send does not
spend the reporter's allowance.

```typescript
interface BugReportOutcome {
  ok: boolean;
  issue_url: string | null;
  message: string;   // shown verbatim; the relay may write it
}
```

#### `save_bug_report(statement: UserStatement, path: string) -> string`
Writes the report as Markdown to `path`. Never rate-limited, never needs a
network. Returns the path written.

#### `suggested_bug_report_filename() -> string`
A timestamped filename for the save dialog.

#### `reset_bug_report_identity() -> string`
Throws away the installation identifier and the local submission history, and
returns the new identifier.

---

### Overlay

The overlay window has no explicit show/hide command. On Windows it is built
once at startup (`window::open_overlay_window`) and stays mapped for the
app's lifetime. On Linux the window is created and destroyed entirely from
the Rust backend (`tray::spawn_status_ticker`, which polls the same
recording/speaking/MCP-recording state and `ui.show_overlay` /
`tts.response_overlay` / `mcp.visual_feedback` / command-pill state that
decides everything else that reacts to them), not requested by the
frontend - a WebKitGTK repaint workaround. Once the window exists, its
*content* is driven by the `status-tick` / `audio-level` events the same
way every other consumer of those already reacts to them. See the
[Overlay UI Guide](./overlays.md).

#### `get_custom_overlays() -> CustomOverlayInfo[]`
Lists every user-authored custom overlay folder under the local overlays
directory (see `get_custom_overlays_dir`), alongside the built-in styles in
the `ui.overlay_style` picker.

```typescript
interface CustomOverlayInfo {
  name: string;
  html: string;
  css: string;
}

const overlays = await invoke<CustomOverlayInfo[]>('get_custom_overlays');
```

#### `get_custom_overlay(name: string) -> CustomOverlayInfo | null`
Re-reads a single custom overlay folder by its display name - used to reload
just the active style rather than the whole list.

```typescript
const overlay = await invoke<CustomOverlayInfo | null>('get_custom_overlay', { name: 'Custom' });
```

#### `get_custom_overlays_dir() -> string`
The resolved, absolute path to the custom-overlays folder, for display in
Settings.

```typescript
const dir = await invoke<string>('get_custom_overlays_dir');
```

---

### Window & Setup Management

#### `get_setup_status() -> SetupStatusPayload`
Returns comprehensive first-run readiness: shortcut health, active speech model status, missing injection tools (`wtype`/`xdotool`), and polkit privileges.

#### `download_configured_model() -> void`
Downloads the speech model selected by the active configuration.

#### `open_setup_wizard() -> void`
Spawns the first-run Setup Wizard window on demand.

#### `finish_setup_wizard(openSettings: boolean) -> void`
Marks setup complete (`ui.setup_completed = true`), emits `config-changed`, closes the wizard, and optionally opens Settings.

#### `open_settings_tab(tab: string) -> void`
Opens the Settings window and switches directly to the specified tab (`"general"`, `"engine"`, `"hotkeys"`, `"audio"`, `"tts"`, `"features"`, `"visual"`, `"openai"`, `"targets"`, `"bugreport"`).

#### `get_available_monitors() -> MonitorInfo[]`
Queries connected display monitors (names, dimensions, primary flag) on the main thread.

```typescript
interface MonitorInfo {
  name: string | null;
  width: number;
  height: number;
  is_primary: boolean;
}
```

---

## Tauri Events (Backend -> Frontend)

Subscribe with `listen()` from `@tauri-apps/api/event`.

```typescript
import { listen } from '@tauri-apps/api/event';
```

### `status-tick`
Emitted whenever the application state changes, and otherwise as a heartbeat
under a second apart. The backend compares each payload against the last and
skips sending an identical one, so an idle app is quiet without the frontend's
staleness fallback ever tripping.

```typescript
await listen<AppStatus>('status-tick', (event) => {
  console.log(event.payload.recording);
});
```

### `config-changed`
Emitted when the config is saved (from any window or external change).

```typescript
await listen<AppConfig>('config-changed', (event) => {
  config.set(event.payload);
});
```

### `audio-level`
Emitted with the current RMS energy level (0.0-1.0+) while recording or
monitoring - the overlay visualisers and the Audio Input tab's VU meter respectively.
Nothing is emitted when neither is watching.

The microphone produces a level for every buffer it delivers, which is far more
often than anything can draw; they are coalesced to at most one event per frame
(16 ms), newest value winning.

```typescript
await listen<number>('audio-level', (event) => {
  updateVuMeter(event.payload);
});
```

### `update-progress`
Emitted while an update downloads, at most once per megabyte.

```typescript
await listen<{ downloaded: number; total: number }>('update-progress', (event) => {
  // total is 0 when the server sent no content length
});
```

### `update-installed`
Emitted with the new version once it is in place. The app exits shortly after
and the new build starts itself.

### `update-failed`
Emitted with a message when an update could not be installed. The running
version is unchanged.
