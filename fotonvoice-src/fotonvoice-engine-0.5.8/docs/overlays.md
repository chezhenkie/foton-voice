# Overlay UI Guide

FotonVoice Engine displays a visual overlay while the microphone is active, while TTS is speaking, or while the MCP server is actively recording (provided Visual Feedback is enabled). The built-in overlay styles are rendered by an ordinary Tauri **`WebviewWindow`** - the `/overlay` Svelte route (`src/lib/Overlay/Overlay.svelte`) drawn in a borderless, transparent, always-on-top, click-through window (592x222 logical px on Windows, 1184x444 on Linux, which rebuilds the window per activation and gives custom overlay designs more room) over whatever application is in focus. It's the same component tree used for the style preview in Settings, so what you see there is exactly what appears during a real dictation.

---

## How the Overlay Works

On Windows, `window::open_overlay_window` (`src-tauri/src/window.rs`) builds and configures the overlay window once, at application startup, and it stays mapped for the life of the app - the `/overlay` route just renders nothing visible while idle rather than the window being hidden and remade each time.

On Linux it is different, deliberately: `tray::spawn_status_ticker` (`src-tauri/src/tray.rs`) owns the window's lifecycle - it is created fresh the moment there's something to show and destroyed again once idle for half a second. That's a workaround for a WebKitGTK bug: on some systems (confirmed: KDE, XWayland) WebKitGTK never repaints this window's transparent buffer back to blank on its own, so a mapped-forever window kept displaying whatever was last composited, frozen on screen. Destroying and recreating it sidesteps that - a freshly created window has never had anything painted into it. The lifecycle lives in the backend's status ticker rather than the overlay's own frontend: destroying the window destroys the code that would have to ask for it back.

Once the window exists, its content is driven the same way on both platforms: the `status-tick` and `audio-level` Tauri events the backend already emits app-wide (see `src/stores/status.ts`), so no separate IPC protocol exists for the overlay.

To avoid focus-stealing and window manager focus grabs during dictation, the window is configured with the following properties:

- **Created at Startup (Windows) / On Demand (Linux)** - On Windows the window is created and shown immediately on launch, before any dictation happens, so the compositor has already registered, anchored, and placed it by the time it's needed. On Linux the backend creates it the instant there's something to show; `open_overlay_window` re-applies the same configuration on every build.
- **Non-Focusable & Taskbar Bypassing** - On Linux, the underlying GTK window is given the `WindowTypeHint::Utility` hint (not `Notification`: KWin's X11/XWayland compositing path handles notification windows with short-lived-oriented repaint handling, which contributed to the frozen-frame bug above; `Utility` goes through the ordinary persistent-panel compositing path while still being excluded from alt-tab). On Windows and macOS the Tauri window builder's own `skip_taskbar` + `focused(false)` options apply. Consequently, the window is excluded from taskbar/app bar listings and does not take keyboard focus or steal focus from the user's cursor.
- **Transparent** - The window background is fully transparent (`transparent(true)`, `shadow(false)`); only the active visualizer elements, rendered as ordinary HTML/CSS/SVG, are visible.
- **Always-on-Top** - Floats persistently above all other active desktop windows. Because a window manager can restack the overlay behind another window mid-session and it never recovers on its own, `window::reassert_overlay_topmost` re-sends the always-on-top state on a ~1s heartbeat while a dictation is active (see `pipeline::spawn_audio_level_forwarder`), not just once at creation.
- **Click-Through** - `set_ignore_cursor_events(true)` disables the window's cursor hit-test at the windowing-system level, so mouse events pass cleanly through to the window beneath it.
- **Borderless / Frameless** - No title bar or decorations.
- **Wayland** - Wayland gives clients no way to position themselves or force always-on-top (that's compositor policy, not a client request), so on a Wayland session with a reachable X server, FotonVoice Engine forces the whole app onto XWayland at startup (`GDK_BACKEND=x11`, set in `lib.rs` before GTK initializes) to get real positioning and stacking back.

The overlay reveals itself automatically when recording starts and fades out when transcription completes (provided `ui.show_overlay` is enabled). The active style is determined by `config.ui.overlay_style` and is hot-switched without recreating the window. Position updates (`config.ui.overlay_position` / `overlay_monitor`) also apply live - see `window::reposition_overlay` and its caller in `lib.rs`.

### Load & Unload Animations

Every built-in style plays a dedicated load animation when it appears and an unload animation when it disappears, using CSS transitions/keyframes tuned to read as a slightly-underdamped spring (so overlays land with a subtle bounce). The animation is driven client-side in the Svelte component; the window stays alive for the whole animation - on Linux the backend only destroys it after the animation's own unmount delay plus a 500ms debounce, so the unload animation is never cut off mid-play; on Windows the window is never destroyed at all. Each style interprets its own load/unload transition - see the per-style descriptions below.

## Screen Positioning

The visual presentation overlay window can be positioned dynamically on the active monitor where your mouse cursor or focused application is located. 

Users can configure the screen alignment under **Settings** -> **Visual Feedback** -> **Overlay position** or manually in `config.json` via `ui.overlay_position`.

Available screen positions:
- **`"center"` (Default)** - Positions the overlay at the exact horizontal and vertical center of the active monitor.
- **`"top"`** - Positions the overlay at the horizontal center, aligned `60` logical pixels from the top of the monitor.
- **`"bottom"`** - Positions the overlay at the horizontal center, aligned `60` logical pixels from the bottom of the monitor.

Tauri dynamically calculates physical pixel values taking into account your display's current high-DPI scaling factor (`scale_factor`), ensuring perfect resolution-independent positioning on 1080p, 1440p, or 4K monitors. Changes to the position setting are instantly applied in real-time if the overlay window is currently visible.

## Target Display / Multi-Monitor Support

In multi-monitor setups, FotonVoice Engine allows you to specify exactly which display screen the visual overlay should appear on.

You can configure the target display under **Settings** -> **Visual Feedback** -> **Overlay display** or manually in `config.json` via `ui.overlay_monitor`.

Options:
- **`"primary"` (Default)** - Constrains the overlay to the OS-defined primary display screen.
- **Specific Monitor Name (e.g. `"HDMI-1"`, `"DP-2"`)** - Connected displays are dynamically queried once at application startup. Selecting one of these binds the visualizer to that specific panel.

### Graceful Disconnection Failover

If the configured target monitor is unplugged or disconnected at runtime, the Tauri backend will automatically fail over to the **Primary Monitor** to keep the visualizer fully accessible. When this happens, a golden warning badge will be displayed inside the settings UI to alert you that the target display is disconnected and fallback mode is active.

## Built-in Styles

Eight built-in styles are available - each with its own visual identity, its own kind of audio visualizer, its own load/unload animation, and a clear indicator of the active routing target. The default is **Ocean Wave**.

All styles share three state palettes: **Recording** (the style's signature color), **Initializing** (amber, while the microphone stream is connecting), and **Processing** (sky blue, while the AI is transcribing).

### Ocean Wave *(default - `"blue_wave"`)*
A glass tide pool at night, complete with a glowing moon and rising bubbles.
- **Visualizer**: three layered sine waves (deep blue -> cyan -> ice teal) whose tide level *and* amplitude rise with your voice. The bottom of the water is always locked to the bottom of the pool - only the waterline moves.
- **Target indicator**: a buoy tag that floats and bobs on the front wave's surface, showing the active target label.
- **Load/unload**: the water fills the pool from the bottom on load and drains back out on unload.
- **States**: "high tide - listening", "low tide - preparing" (initializing), "deep current - processing" (waves shift indigo and surge).

### Voice Card (`"voice_card"`)
A literal membership card: gold contact chip, embossed FOTONVOICE branding, and a holographic sheen that drifts across the face.
- **Visualizer**: a 20x6 VU-meter LED dot matrix (green -> amber -> red, lit bottom-up) with real VU ballistics - instant attack, slow decay - and a centre-weighted envelope.
- **Target indicator**: an embossed `TARGET` field in the card's bottom-left corner, plus a blinking `REC` / `INIT` / `PROC` status stamp top-right.
- **Load/unload**: the card deals in with a flip (horizontal unfold from its centre) and flips back out on unload.

### Waveform (`"waveform"`)
A green-phosphor oscilloscope ("WAVEFORM // OSC-01") with a graticule grid.
- **Visualizer**: a live scrolling line trace of the microphone signal, rendered in two passes (a wide phosphor glow underneath a crisp trace line). Positive samples deflect upward, like a real scope.
- **Target indicator**: a `TGT >` readout chip in the scope's top-right corner.
- **Load/unload**: a CRT power-on - the panel expands vertically from a single scanline - and collapses back into the line on unload.
- **States**: "LIVE TRACE" (green), "CALIBRATING" (amber), "TRANSCRIBING" (blue sine sweep on the scope).

### Pulse Ring (`"pulse"`)
A sonar/radar dial paired with a target-lock plate.
- **Visualizer**: a rotating sweep arm with a faded trailing wedge, expanding pulse rings whose brightness tracks your voice, contact blips that flash as the sweep passes their bearing, and an audio-reactive core that swells with the microphone level.
- **Target indicator**: a "PULSE // TARGET LOCK" plate beside the dial with a pulsing reticle (+) and lock frame showing the active target label.
- **Load/unload**: the dial drops in and the lock plate slides out from behind it; both reverse on unload.
- **States**: "TARGET LOCK" (tangerine), "ACQUIRING" (amber), "ANALYZING" (blue).

### Mono Bars (`"mono_bars"`)
A hyper-minimal, pure black & white panel - no color, no gradients, no glow.
- **Visualizer**: a 5-bar level meter, centre-weighted so the middle bar reacts most strongly, with a gentle ripple traveling across the row while recording and all bars pulsing in lock-step while processing.
- **Target indicator**: a small caption beneath the bars showing the active target label.
- **Load/unload**: the whole panel simply fades in and out - no motion, scaling, or color, in keeping with its minimal aesthetic.
- **States**: "LISTENING" (dot lit, blinking), "STANDBY" (dim, dot hollow - initializing), "PROCESSING" (bars pulse together, dot blinks faster).

### Neon Spectrum (`"spectrum"`)
A 16-band equalizer in a deep-violet panel with a magenta-to-cyan gradient and a soft glow.
- **Visualizer**: 16 bars across a magenta -> purple -> cyan gradient. Bass (left) bands swing wider and slower; treble (right) bands flicker faster with a smaller share of the level.
- **Target indicator**: an "OUT >" chip in the header showing the active target label.
- **Load/unload**: the panel rises up out of the floor - its height grows while the bars stay anchored to the bottom edge - and sinks back down on unload.
- **States**: "- LIVE" (magenta LED), "- WARMING UP" (amber, initializing), "- ANALYZING" (blue, bars pulse in a traveling wave while processing).

### Retro Terminal (`"terminal"`)
A DOS-blue console window with a three-dot title bar and monospace readouts.
- **Visualizer**: a block-character ASCII meter (`#`/`-`) that fills left-to-right with the audio level.
- **Target indicator**: a `$ fotonvoice-engine listen --target "..."` command line showing the active target label.
- **Load/unload**: the console drops down from the top edge on load and retracts back up on unload.
- **States**: "[REC ]" (white meter, "streaming to output"), "[INIT]" (amber, "connecting input device"), "[PROC]" (sky blue, "transcribing audio stream"), with a blinking text cursor.

### Analog VU (`"vinyl"`)
A warm, vintage VU meter in cream and amber tones with a real dial face.
- **Visualizer**: a spring-loaded needle that kicks toward the audio level and settles with realistic ballistics (the same critically-damped spring used for load/unload animations), sweeping across a `-20` to `+3` scale.
- **Target indicator**: a caption beneath the meter face showing the active target label.
- **Load/unload**: the panel fades in and settles upward slightly into place on load, and reverses on unload.
- **States**: red LED + needle resting at `-20` (idle/standby), amber LED (initializing), blue LED with the needle sweeping on its own (processing), red LED with the needle tracking your voice (recording).

### Speaking Pill

While TTS is responding, a green "SYSTEM RESPONDING" pill slides up from the bottom of the overlay with a live mini-equalizer and the active target label, and slides back down when speech ends.

### Command Trigger Overlay Pill

When a voice command trigger is activated (e.g. saying *"FotonVoice Engine notes Help me!"*), a purple/indigo glassmorphism command pill slides up from the bottom of the overlay window:
- **Visuals**: Dark purple/indigo background (`rgba(30, 16, 60, 0.94)`) with a glowing purple border (`#a855f7`) and a flashing lightning bolt icon (`!`).
- **Content**: Displays the executed command target name (e.g. `NOTES` or `MEETING JOURNAL`) and a summary of the text payload (`> Help me!`).
- **Duration**: Auto-dismisses after a configurable duration (default: 3 seconds, configurable via `config.ui.command_overlay_duration_secs`).
- **Toggle**: Controlled via **Settings -> Visual Feedback -> Show overlay on voice command trigger** (`config.ui.show_command_overlay`).

## Custom Overlay Styles

Beyond the eight built-in styles, FotonVoice Engine loads user-authored styles from
an overlays folder - `dirs::data_local_dir()/fotonvoice-engine/overlays` (Rust's
`dirs` crate; e.g. `~/.local/share/fotonvoice-engine/overlays` on Linux) - via
`custom_overlays::overlays_dir()` in `src-tauri/src/custom_overlays.rs`.
Every subfolder containing an `index.html` + `style.css` becomes a
selectable style in **Settings -> Visual & Feedback -> Overlay style**,
named after the folder. Two different commands read this folder for two
different purposes, both in `src-tauri/src/commands.rs`:
- `get_custom_overlays` lists every folder's name (not its content) to
  populate `VisualTab.svelte`'s `overlayStyleOptions` - the dropdown.
- `get_custom_overlay(name)` reads one folder's `index.html` + `style.css`
  fresh off disk, by the display name it's selected under.
  `Overlay.svelte`'s shared `loadActiveCustomOverlay(style)` calls this -
  not the list command - and is itself called three different ways,
  deliberately, not just one:
  1. `VisualTab.svelte` emits an `overlay-style-selected` event, with the
     new value, on every selection in the Overlay style dropdown -
     including re-selecting the style that's already active - and
     `Overlay.svelte` listens for it directly. This bypasses the config
     store entirely, so it's the reliable trigger for "I edited the file,
     does picking this style in Settings show it right now," for *both*
     `index.html` and `style.css` together (`read_custom_overlay_folder`
     always reads both in one call - there's no independent per-file
     caching to go stale).
  2. The `isRecordingOrSpeaking` effect, every time it transitions to
     active - so every dictation start re-reads the currently selected
     style's files too, independent of anything Settings did.
  3. A style-change `$effect` that reacts to `config.ui.overlay_style`
     itself changing, kept as a fallback for config changes that don't
     originate from that dropdown (e.g. `config.json` edited by hand).
     This one alone isn't reliable: this window's own copy of that value
     only updates when it *receives* a `config-changed` event carrying a
     different value than it already had, and Settings auto-saves on a
     debounce, so switching the dropdown away and back quickly can
     collapse into a single save this window never observes as a change -
     an effect keyed on the style value alone can silently never re-fire
     in that case. Triggers 1 and 2 don't have this gap: neither cares
     whether the *value* changed, only that a selection or an activation
      happened. Because the overlay window persists across activations (on
      Windows it is created once at startup and stays alive for the whole
      session, and on Linux the backend keeps it alive through the 500ms
      idle debounce between dictations), without
      at least one of these three, whatever was on disk at startup is all
      it would ever show.

`custom_overlays::refresh_bundled_example` (called once, before `run()`
builds the Tauri app) makes sure a documented `Custom/` example exists -
a copy of the built-in Voice Card style with one line changed (`FOTONVOICE`
-> `CUSTOM OVERLAY`), from the template files under
`src-tauri/assets/custom-overlay-template/` - without ever overwriting it
once it's there. It writes `README.md` unconditionally on every launch
(it's reference documentation, not user content), but only creates
`Custom/index.html` + `style.css` when the `Custom/` folder doesn't exist
at all; the instant it exists, seeded or hand-edited, this is a no-op on
every future launch, and stays that way until the user deletes the whole
folder themselves - that deletion is the only way to ask for the default
example back. This is deliberately a plain existence check, not an
attempt to detect edits by content or hash: an earlier version tried
diffing against a marker of its own last-written content to tell "still
untouched, safe to upgrade" apart from "the user has edited this," which
worked but added real complexity for a distinction that turned out not to
matter - once `Custom/` exists, leave it alone, full stop. Nothing
outside `README.md` and `Custom/` is ever touched, so any *other* style
the user has created is always left alone.

A custom overlay's `index.html` gets `{{target}}` / `{{trigger}}`
placeholder substitution on its first render (the active routing target's
label). Everything that changes afterward - recording/processing/speaking
state, the live audio level - has to be read from CSS: FotonVoice Engine continuously
writes it onto custom properties on the page root (`--fotonvoice-recording`,
`--fotonvoice-processing`, `--fotonvoice-speaking`, `--fotonvoice-mcp-recording`,
`--fotonvoice-audio-ready`, all 0/1, plus `--fotonvoice-audio-level` 0..1), for
`var()`/`calc()` to consume directly - see the shipped `Custom/index.html`
and `style.css` for a fully commented, working example (the on/off flip,
the status-stamp text swap, and the audio-reactive LED matrix are all
driven this way, with no script).

This is CSS-only because it has to be: the window's `script-src 'self'`
content-security-policy (`src-tauri/tauri.conf.json`) blocks inline
`<script>` execution everywhere in the app, custom overlays included, with
no visible error in the (console-less) overlay window - a `<script>`-based
overlay just silently never appears. `Overlay.svelte` does still dispatch
`fotonvoice-status` / `fotonvoice-audio-level` / `fotonvoice-cleanup` `CustomEvent`s
on `window` for an overlay's own script to listen for, but nothing in this
app can currently execute that script, so treat those events as unusable
under the shipped CSP rather than as the documented way to build one.
