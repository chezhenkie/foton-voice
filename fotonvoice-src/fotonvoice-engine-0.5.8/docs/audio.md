# Audio Pipeline

**Crate:** `crates/fotonvoice-audio/`

## Responsibilities

- Enumerate and select audio input devices
- Stream raw PCM from the microphone via CPAL
- Resample from the hardware rate to 16 kHz (Whisper's required input rate)
- Compute RMS levels for the VU meter and VAD noise gate
- Suppress background noise with RNNoise when `audio.noise_suppression` is on
- Support two streaming modes: dynamic (on-demand) and always-on

---

## Device Selection

On startup, `test_and_detect_active_device()` probes devices in priority order:

1. **Configured device** - `audio.input_device_index` from config (if non-null)
2. **Default input device** - CPAL's `default_input_device()`
3. **First enumerable device** - iterates all input devices, picks first that builds a stream

A test stream is opened on each candidate to confirm it is functional before committing. If none succeed, CPAL's default device is used as a last resort.

Devices are enumerated with `list_input_devices()`, which returns `(index: u32, name: String)` pairs for the Settings -> Audio Input tab.

The device can be **hot-reloaded** at runtime: if `audio.input_device_index` changes (via the UI), the capture loop detects the change and re-opens the stream on the new device without restarting.

## Streaming Modes

### Dynamic Streaming (default, `dynamic_stream: true`)
The microphone stream is opened when recording starts and closed when it stops.

- Lower CPU/battery usage when idle
- Startup latency is whatever the audio device takes to open - typically tens
  of milliseconds. The capture supervisor itself adds none: starting a
  recording signals it directly rather than leaving it to a poll.
- Suitable for most users
- Anything spoken while the device is still opening is not recorded, because
  nothing is listening yet. This is the mode to leave if your first word keeps
  going missing.

### Always-On Streaming (`dynamic_stream: false`)
The stream stays open permanently. Chunks are forwarded to the recording buffer only while recording is active; they are discarded otherwise.

- Zero startup latency
- Higher idle CPU usage
- The stream also runs during VU meter monitoring (Settings -> Audio Input tab)
- **Nothing is clipped from the start of an utterance.** The last
  `PREROLL_MS` (300 ms) of audio is kept in a ring buffer while idle and
  prepended to the recording, so speech that began before the shortcut landed
  is still in the audio the recogniser sees. That matters most for the wake
  word in a voice command, which is the first thing said and the first thing
  lost.

Both modes also serve the live audio monitoring flag used by the VU meter in the Settings -> Audio Input tab.

The pre-roll can only hold what the microphone was already hearing, so it
applies whenever the stream is open ahead of the recording: always-on mode, or
a dynamic stream still up because the Audio Input tab is monitoring.

## Audio Processing Chain

```
Hardware input (e.g. 48000 Hz, f32 samples)
        |
        v
   apply_gain()         - multiply each sample by gain (atomic f32, live-updated)
        |
        v
   rms() -> level_tx     - f32 RMS, produced only while recording or monitoring
                          and coalesced downstream to one event per frame
        |
        v
   resample_chunk()      - linear interpolation to 16000 Hz (if hardware rate differs)
        |
        v
   audio_tx.send(chunk)  - Vec<f32> forwarded to lib.rs accumulator (only if recording=true)
```

### Resampling

`resample_chunk(input, from_hz, to_hz)` uses simple linear interpolation to convert from the hardware sample rate to 16 kHz. This is fast and low-latency, which is more important than perfect fidelity for speech recognition.

### Gain Control

`audio.gain` is stored as an `AtomicU32` (bit-cast from f32) in `AppState`, allowing live updates from the UI without locking the audio thread.

## Noise Suppression

With `audio.noise_suppression` on, each captured buffer goes through RNNoise
(the [`nnnoiseless`](https://crates.io/crates/nnnoiseless) port) before it
reaches inference. RNNoise applies per-band gains learned to keep voiced speech
and pull down steady broadband noise - fans, hiss, hum, air conditioning.

The denoiser lives in `crates/fotonvoice-audio/src/denoise.rs` and reconciles three
mismatched formats inside the capture callback:

```
mic buffer (hardware rate, [-1.0, 1.0])
  -> resample to 48 kHz            RNNoise runs at 48 kHz only
  -> scale to 16-bit range         RNNoise wants [-32768.0, 32767.0] floats
  -> process in 480-sample frames  a whole frame at a time; the remainder is
                                  carried into the next callback
  -> scale back, resample to 16 kHz
```

The first frame out of RNNoise is discarded (it carries fade-in artifacts), and
because only whole frames are processed, up to 10 ms is still buffered when a
recording ends.

State is per stream: opening a stream builds a fresh denoiser, so a device
change never continues with the spectral estimate of the device it left.

**Build requirement.** RNNoise is compiled in behind the `noisereduce` cargo
feature on `fotonvoice-audio`. The app enables it (`src-tauri/Cargo.toml`), so
released builds have it. A build without it logs a warning when the setting is
on and passes audio through unchanged.

**Live toggle.** `AppState.noise_suppression` mirrors the setting as an
`AtomicBool` the capture callback reads per buffer, so switching it in Settings
applies to the next recording without a restart or a stream rebuild.

## Noise Gate / VAD

Voice Activity Detection is applied in the inference layer (not capture), after the full recording is accumulated:

```
rms_threshold = (1.0 - audio.vad_threshold) * 0.006

IF rms(audio) < rms_threshold
THEN discard - return empty string
```

**VAD threshold interpretation:**
- `0.5` (default) -> rms_threshold = 0.003 (comfortable speech easily passes)
- `1.0` (maximum sensitivity) -> rms_threshold = 0.0 (no gate; all audio processed)
- `0.0` (minimum sensitivity) -> rms_threshold = 0.006 (only loud audio passes)

Setting it too low (high sensitivity) can cause Whisper to transcribe silence as hallucinated text. The default 0.5 is well-calibrated for typical microphone setups.

## Configuration Options

All under `audio` in `config.json`:

| Key | Type | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `input_device_index` | integer or null | `null` | CPAL device index; null = auto-detect |
| `evdev_device` | string or null | `null` | Linux evdev keyboard path, e.g. `"/dev/input/event4"`. Only used by the evdev hotkey fallback; ignored when the desktop portal is available (the normal case) |
| `gain` | float | `1.0` | Microphone amplification multiplier |
| `vad_threshold` | float | `0.5` | Sensitivity 0.0-1.0; higher = more sensitive (0.0 RMS gate at 1.0) |
| `noise_suppression` | bool | `false` | Run captured audio through RNNoise before transcription (see [Noise Suppression](#noise-suppression)) |
| `dynamic_stream` | bool | `true` | Open/close mic on demand vs. always-on |

## AudioRecorder

`AudioRecorder` is constructed with shared atomics from `AppState` so it reacts to live config changes without restarts:

```rust
pub struct AudioRecorder {
    config: AudioConfig,
    recording: Arc<AtomicBool>,
    monitoring: Arc<AtomicBool>,
    dynamic_stream: Arc<AtomicBool>,
    input_device_index: Arc<AtomicU32>,
    gain: Arc<AtomicU32>,
    noise_suppression: Arc<AtomicBool>,
}
```

It is started via `.run(audio_tx, level_tx, audio_ready)` which spawns the `capture_loop` on a dedicated OS thread. The loop watches for device index changes, dynamic stream preference changes, and recording/monitoring state transitions. It is signalled the moment one of those flags is set - `AudioRecorder::with_wake` supplies the channel - so a dynamic stream opens the microphone on the keypress rather than at the next poll; the 200 ms interval underneath is only a backstop.
