## Development Workflow

### Start Dev Server
```bash
npm install          # Install frontend deps (first time only)
npm run tauri dev    # Start Tauri + Vite in development mode
```

This:
1. Starts Vite dev server on `http://localhost:5173` with HMR
2. Compiles the Rust backend
3. Launches the app with the WebView pointed at Vite

Svelte changes hot-reload instantly. Rust changes trigger a backend recompile (typically 5-30s).

### Frontend Only
If you only need to work on the UI:
```bash
npm run dev
# Opens http://localhost:5173 in browser
# Note: Tauri commands won't work in browser - mock them if needed
```

### Type-Check the Frontend
```bash
npm run check        # Runs svelte-check (Svelte + TypeScript) against tsconfig.json
```
This is the same check CI runs on every push/PR. Tailwind `@apply`/`@reference`
warnings from `svelte-check` are expected (it does not parse Tailwind directives)
and do not fail the build; only genuine type errors do.

### Backend Only
```bash
cargo build -p fotonvoice-inference  # Build a specific crate
cargo test -p fotonvoice-config      # Test a specific crate
cargo check --workspace          # Type-check all crates
```

---

## Building for Production

### AppImage (Linux)
```bash
bash build_appimage.sh
# Output: fotonvoice-engine.AppImage in project root
```

The build script:
1. Runs `npm run tauri build` to produce a `.deb` bundle
2. Extracts the contents into an AppDir
3. Runs `appimagetool` to create the AppImage

### Standard Tauri Build
```bash
npm run tauri build
# Output: src-tauri/target/release/bundle/
#   Linux:   .deb, .AppImage
#   Windows: .msi, .exe (NSIS)
```

### CUDA GPU Acceleration (opt-in)

CUDA inference acceleration is disabled by default so the app builds on any machine. Enable it with the `cuda` cargo feature:

```bash
# Linux / macOS
npm run tauri build -- --features cuda

# Windows (PowerShell)
npm run tauri build -- --features cuda

The `--` is required - without it npm treats `--features` as its own flag and
fails with `EUNKNOWNCONFIG`.

The two ONNX-backed engines - `moonshine` (speech-to-text) and `inflect-micro`
(text-to-speech) - are **default features**, so a plain build includes both and
neither needs naming. They share one ONNX Runtime, which is fetched at build
time and linked in, so builds need network access to that host. To build
without it:

```bash
npm run tauri build -- --no-default-features --features custom-protocol
```

In such a build, selecting Moonshine falls back to whisper-cpp, and the Inflect
TTS engine still downloads its model but leaves Test TTS disabled - only
synthesis is gated.

### Pocket-TTS / Breeze-TTS-2 / VoxCPM2 on the GPU

These three engines run through [audio.cpp](https://github.com/0xShug0/audio.cpp)'s
prebuilt `audiocpp_cli` binary, which already ships a Vulkan backend - no
FotonVoice Engine build feature is needed. Toggling `gpu` in Settings for any of them
just switches the `--backend` flag passed to that subprocess between `vulkan`
and `cpu`. If no usable Vulkan device is found, `audiocpp_cli` reports the
failure as a normal TTS error rather than silently downgrading.

### Noise suppression

RNNoise sits behind `noisereduce` on `fotonvoice-audio`, and `src-tauri` enables it,
so a normal build can honor the Audio Input tab's noise-suppression toggle. Building
`fotonvoice-audio` on its own (or with `--no-default-features` on that crate) leaves
it out, and the toggle then logs a warning and passes audio through unchanged.
Its tests need the feature:

```bash
cargo test -p fotonvoice-audio --features noisereduce
```
# Or use the helper script:
.\scripts\build_windows.ps1 -Cuda
```

The `cuda` feature propagates: `fotonvoice-app/cuda` -> `fotonvoice-inference/cuda` -> `whisper-rs/cuda`.

---

## Crate Development Guide

Each crate under `crates/` is self-contained. They are included in the workspace `Cargo.toml` and referenced by `src-tauri` as path dependencies.

### Adding a new crate
```bash
cargo new --lib crates/fotonvoice-myfeature

# Add to Cargo.toml workspace members:
[workspace]
members = [
  ...
  "crates/fotonvoice-myfeature",
]

# Reference from src-tauri/Cargo.toml:
fotonvoice-myfeature = { path = "../crates/fotonvoice-myfeature" }
```

### Crate Conventions
- Keep each crate focused on one domain
- Expose a minimal public API (`pub` on types/functions needed by callers)
- Use `tokio` for async where I/O is needed; keep CPU-heavy work on dedicated OS threads
- Pass channels rather than `Arc<Mutex<_>>` for data pipelines where possible

---

## Key Files to Understand

### `src-tauri/src/lib.rs`
The main coordinator. This is where the audio pipeline is assembled:
- Creates all channels
- Spawns the hotkey listener
- Spawns the audio recorder
- Spawns the inference worker
- Starts the MCP server
- Starts the DBus service
- Runs the Tauri event loop with the status ticker

When adding a new integration, this is typically where you wire it in.

### `src-tauri/src/commands.rs`
All `#[tauri::command]` handlers. Each command is a thin wrapper that reads/writes `AppState` or calls into a crate. Keep commands small - business logic belongs in crates.

### `crates/fotonvoice-config/src/lib.rs`
The `AppConfig` struct is the source of truth for all settings. If you add a config option, add it here first, then expose it in the Settings UI.

### `crates/fotonvoice-routing/src/models.rs`
Defines `OutputTarget`, `HotkeyBinding`, `DeliveryType`, `TargetProcessingConfig`, and `GestureType`. Add new delivery types or target fields here.

---

## Adding a New Output Command Delivery Type

1. Add a variant to `DeliveryType` enum in `crates/fotonvoice-routing/src/models.rs`
2. Add any target-specific fields to `OutputTarget` in `crates/fotonvoice-routing/src/models.rs`
3. Add a match arm in the router dispatch logic in `crates/fotonvoice-routing/src/router.rs`
4. Update the TypeScript `OutputTarget` interface in `src/stores/config.ts`
5. Add the new type to the "Delivery System" selector in `src/lib/Settings/TargetEditorModal.svelte` (opened from `CommandsTab.svelte`, the Output Commands tab)
6. Document in `docs/routing.md`

---

## Testing

FotonVoice Engine utilizes a multi-tiered, unified testing suite spanning Svelte frontend components, Rust backend crates, and end-to-end integration tests over local socket connections.

### Master Test Orchestrator

The easiest way to run the entire test suite (Rust, Svelte, and Pytest Integration) is via the master test runner script:

```bash
npm test
```

This runs `python3 scripts/run_tests.py`, which sequences the following three test suites and returns a consolidated exit code (cleanly skipping the integration tests with a warning if `pytest` is not installed on the system):
1. **Rust Backend tests** (`cargo test`)
2. **Svelte Frontend tests** (`npm run test:unit`)
3. **Python Integration tests** (`pytest tests/integration/`)

---

### Rust Backend Crate Tests

Backend logic, including settings schemas, migrations, routing models, and utilities, is tested using standard Rust/Cargo unit tests.

#### Running Backend Tests
```bash
# Run all tests across the entire workspace
cargo test --workspace

# Run tests for a specific backend crate
cargo test -p fotonvoice-config
cargo test -p fotonvoice-routing
```

The overlay's visualizer/animation logic lives in the Svelte components under `src/lib/Overlay/` (see `docs/overlays.md`) and is covered by the frontend test suite (`npm run test:unit`), not backend Rust tests.

#### Writing Backend Tests
Backend unit tests are written inside their respective crate files within a `#[cfg(test)]` module block.
Example from `crates/fotonvoice-config/src/lib.rs`:
```rust
#[cfg(test)]
mod tests {
    use super::*;

    #[test]
    fn test_default_config_values() {
        let cfg = AppConfig::default();
        assert!(!cfg.ui.auto_show_settings);
        assert_eq!(cfg.ui.overlay_style, OverlayStyle::BlueWave);
    }
}
```

### Svelte Frontend Unit & Component Tests

Frontend Svelte 5 components, settings views, and warning overlays are tested using **Vitest**, **JSDOM**, and **Svelte Testing Library**.

* **Test Location**: `tests/svelte/` (files ending in `.test.ts`, including component tests and utility script tests like `prepare-sidecar.test.ts`)
* **Framework Stack**: Vitest (runner), jsdom (DOM environment), `@testing-library/svelte` (rendering & selectors)

#### Running Frontend Tests
```bash
# Run all frontend tests once
npm run test:unit

# Run frontend tests in interactive watch mode
npx vitest
```

#### Mocking Tauri APIs
Tauri commands (`invoke`) and events (`listen`) are mocked inside Svelte tests using Vitest's `vi.mock` to ensure they run successfully in headless/JSDOM environments without a live Webview context.

Example from `tests/svelte/EngineTab.test.ts`:
```typescript
import { describe, test, expect, vi } from "vitest";
import { render, screen } from "@testing-library/svelte";
import EngineTab from "../../src/lib/Settings/EngineTab.svelte";

// Mock Tauri core commands
vi.mock("@tauri-apps/api/core", () => ({
  invoke: vi.fn(async (cmd, args) => {
    if (cmd === "check_model_downloaded") {
      return args.modelSize === "base"; // mock "base" downloaded, others missing
    }
    return true;
  }),
}));

// Mock Tauri events
vi.mock("@tauri-apps/api/event", () => ({
  listen: vi.fn(async () => {
    return () => {}; // return clean unsubscribe function
  }),
}));
```

#### Writing Svelte Tests
When testing Svelte components:
1. Render the component using `render(Component, { props })`.
2. Locate elements using Svelte Testing Library selectors (e.g., `screen.findByText` or `screen.queryByText`).
3. Assert behaviors using Vitest's `expect()`.

Example:
```typescript
describe("EngineTab.svelte Warning Banner", () => {
  test("shows warning banner if Whisper voice model is not downloaded", async () => {
    const mockConfig = {
      engine: {
        backend: "whisper-cpp",
        whisper_cpp: { model_size: "large-v3" },
      }
    } as any;

    render(EngineTab, { cfg: mockConfig });
    
    // Assert warning banner is found
    const title = await screen.findByText("Voice Model Not Downloaded");
    expect(title).not.toBeNull();
  });
});
```

---

### Python Socket Integration Tests

Integration tests verify end-to-end communication channels such as the Model Context Protocol (MCP) server over Unix domain sockets (`/tmp/fotonvoice-mcp.sock`).

* **Test Location**: `tests/integration/` (files prefixed with `test_`)
* **Framework**: Pytest

#### Running Integration Tests
```bash
# Ensure pytest is installed
pip install pytest

# Run integration tests
pytest tests/integration/
```
*Note: These tests check for the live socket connection. If FotonVoice Engine is not currently running, these tests will gracefully skip to prevent false failure reports.*

#### Writing Integration Tests
Integration tests use the standard `pytest` framework, creating client socket connections to communicate with `/tmp/fotonvoice-mcp.sock` over JSON-RPC.

Example:
```python
import socket
import json
import pytest
import os

SOCKET_PATH = "/tmp/fotonvoice-mcp.sock"

@pytest.mark.skipif(not os.path.exists(SOCKET_PATH), reason="MCP Socket not running")
def test_mcp_handshake_and_tools():
    sock = socket.socket(socket.AF_UNIX, socket.SOCK_STREAM)
    sock.connect(SOCKET_PATH)
    try:
        # Send a standard JSON-RPC request to the MCP server
        payload = {"jsonrpc": "2.0", "id": 1, "method": "tools/list", "params": {}}
        sock.sendall((json.dumps(payload) + "\n").encode('utf-8'))
        
        # Read and parse response
        resp = json.loads(sock.recv(1024).decode('utf-8').strip())
        assert "result" in resp
        assert "tools" in resp["result"]
    finally:
        sock.close()
```

### Simulating and Testing Hotkey Diagnostics

Global shortcuts go through the XDG `GlobalShortcuts` portal, which is a
property of the user's desktop and awkward to vary on a dev machine. The
`FOTONVOICE_TEST_HOTKEY_STATUS` environment variable mocks the outcome so the
first-launch UI can be exercised in every state.

#### How diagnostics work

`commands::hotkey_status()` reports what is actually happening rather than
auditing configuration files:

1. **Backend** - `fotonvoice_hotkeys::ListenerHealth::backend()` says which
   mechanism is live: `Portal`, `Evdev`, `WindowsHook`, `Starting`, or `None`.
   This is ground truth; nothing is inferred from what is on disk.
2. **Privacy** - `is_private()` is true only where something else owns the key
   grab and hands FotonVoice Engine whole shortcuts: the XDG portal, and a Linux Mint
   custom keybinding that invokes FotonVoice Engine over D-Bus. The UI states this in
   plain language, and only when true.

   It is the exact opposite of `Backend::sees_raw_keys()`, and
   `every_backend_either_sees_keys_or_is_private` in `health.rs` enforces that.
   The Windows hook used to be in *both* sets - a `WH_KEYBOARD_LL` hook is
   called for every keystroke on the machine, so the Hotkeys tab showed a
   padlock and "FotonVoice Engine does not read your keyboard" over a backend that reads
   all of it. Deciding a new backend's privacy is now a choice that test
   forces.
3. **Bound shortcuts** - the portal returns what the compositor *actually*
   bound, which may differ from what FotonVoice Engine requested. `BoundShortcut` carries
   both, so the Hotkeys tab can show the real keys and flag anything refused.
4. **Startup grace** - `Starting` reports as active. The portal handshake is
   async, and flashing a failure for a few hundred milliseconds on every launch
   would pop the setup window on a perfectly working install.
5. **Device counts** - only probed on the evdev path. On the portal path
   FotonVoice Engine opens no input devices, so reporting "0 of 8 readable" would be
   accurate but deeply misleading.

#### What must never appear

FotonVoice Engine does not install a udev rule, does not run `usermod -aG input`, and
offers no UI affordance to do either. `installer::build_privileged_setup_script`
is package installation only, and both a Rust test
(`the_privileged_script_never_touches_input_permissions`) and a Svelte test
(`never offers to grant keyboard access`) fail if that regresses. See
[Hotkeys -> Why this changed](hotkeys.md#why-this-changed).

#### Mock configurations

* **Portal working (the normal case)**:
  ```bash
  FOTONVOICE_TEST_HOTKEY_STATUS=portal npm run tauri dev
  ```
  * **UI Outcome**: The setup window's first step is green and states that the
    desktop owns the shortcuts and FotonVoice Engine cannot read the keyboard.

* **evdev fallback (no portal, but input devices are already readable)**:
  ```bash
  FOTONVOICE_TEST_HOTKEY_STATUS=evdev npm run tauri dev
  ```
  * **UI Outcome**: Shortcuts report as working, with an amber note that every
    keystroke passes through FotonVoice Engine in this mode and that the access was not
    created by FotonVoice Engine.

* **Nothing available**:
  ```bash
  FOTONVOICE_TEST_HOTKEY_STATUS=none npm run tauri dev
  ```
  * **UI Outcome**: Spawns the standalone **FotonVoice Engine Setup** window
    (`udev-warning`) in the foreground, explaining that the desktop provides no
    shortcuts portal and why FotonVoice Engine will not grant itself keyboard access,
    with a **Continue anyway** close pathway.

To exercise the real evdev fallback on a desktop that *does* have the portal,
set `FOTONVOICE_DISABLE_PORTAL_HOTKEYS=1`.

## Debugging

### Rust Logging
FotonVoice Engine uses the `log` crate with `env_logger`. Enable verbose output:
```bash
RUST_LOG=debug npm run tauri dev
RUST_LOG=fotonvoice_inference=trace npm run tauri dev
```

### Frontend DevTools
In dev mode, right-click the Tauri window -> Inspect Element to open WebKit DevTools.

### IPC Tracing
Add `console.log` around `invoke()` calls in Svelte, or add `println!` in command handlers in Rust.

### Audio Issues
```bash
# Check CPAL devices
RUST_LOG=cpal=debug npm run tauri dev

# Check PulseAudio
pactl list sources short
```
