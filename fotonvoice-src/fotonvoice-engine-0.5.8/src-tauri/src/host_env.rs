//! Running host programs from inside a bundled app.
//!
//! FotonVoice Engine shells out to programs that belong to the user's desktop, not to
//! FotonVoice Engine: `gsettings` to read and write Cinnamon's keybindings, `dbus-send`
//! to poke the running instance. Inside the AppImage those inherit an
//! environment aimed squarely at the *bundled* runtime - linuxdeploy's GTK hook
//! exports `GSETTINGS_SCHEMA_DIR` into the AppDir, prepends the AppDir to
//! `XDG_DATA_DIRS`, and puts bundled libraries first on `LD_LIBRARY_PATH`.
//!
//! A `gsettings` that inherits all that looks in the AppDir for the Cinnamon
//! schemas, does not find them, and reports that the desktop has no keybinding
//! support at all - which is indistinguishable, from the outside, from running
//! on a desktop that really has none. Handing host programs a host environment
//! is what makes the difference.
