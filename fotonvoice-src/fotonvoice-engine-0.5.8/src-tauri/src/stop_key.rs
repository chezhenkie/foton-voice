//! When FotonVoice Engine is allowed to hold the TTS stop key.
//!
//! The stop key is a global shortcut like any other, with one difference: its
//! default is Escape, and on a desktop where the compositor owns the key grab
//! (the XDG `GlobalShortcuts` portal) a registered shortcut is an *exclusive*
//! grab. Holding Escape for the life of the process meant no other application
//! ever saw it - an open menu would not close, a dialog would not cancel - for
//! as long as FotonVoice Engine was running.
//!
//! Re-emitting the key afterwards does not solve it. A synthetic press enters
//! the same input pipeline the grab sits on, so the compositor intercepts it
//! again: the key never reaches the focused app and FotonVoice Engine's own shortcut
//! fires in a loop. Injecting *below* the compositor (uinput) needs the
//! keyboard access this app deliberately refuses to arrange, and Wayland has no
//! way for one client to deliver a key to another at all.
//!
//! So FotonVoice Engine holds the grab only while it is actually speaking. Escape
//! interrupts playback, which is the whole point of the key, and belongs to the
//! rest of the desktop the rest of the time.
//!
//! None of this applies where FotonVoice Engine watches the key stream itself - the X11
//! raw-event backend, evdev, and the Windows low-level hook all observe without
//! grabbing, so every app receives Escape regardless and the stop key is simply
//! registered for the whole session.
