//! Synthesised keyboard input on Windows, and the marker that identifies it.
//!
//! Everything that puts text into the focused window on Windows goes through
//! here, so there is one implementation to get right and one marker for the
//! hotkey hook to recognise.
//!
//! This replaced a `powershell.exe -Command SendKeys::SendWait` call, which was
//! wrong in a way that only showed up on real dictation. `SendKeys` reads
//! `+ ^ % ~ ( ) { } [ ]` as its own syntax, so "50% (a+b)" arrived as "50"
//! followed by a couple of stray chords, and "array[0]" as "array0". The old
//! code base64-encoded the payload - which does protect it from *PowerShell*
//! parsing, and was a real defence - but the decoded string still went through
//! SendKeys' own escaping, so ordinary prose came out mangled. It also spawned
//! a process per dictation, on the path where latency is most visible.
//!
//! `SendInput` with `KEYEVENTF_UNICODE` carries the character itself rather
//! than a keystroke to be interpreted: no escaping exists to get wrong, no
//! keyboard layout is consulted, and nothing is spawned.
//!
//! The chunking logic below is deliberately outside the platform gate so its
//! tests run on the Linux lane, where the suite actually runs.
