//! RNNoise noise suppression for the capture path, behind the `noisereduce`
//! cargo feature.
//!
//! RNNoise is fixed to 48 kHz and works on 480-sample frames of 16-bit-scaled
//! PCM, none of which matches what the microphone hands us: the hardware runs
//! at whatever rate it negotiated, cpal delivers arbitrarily sized buffers of
//! `[-1.0, 1.0]` floats, and inference wants 16 kHz. [`Denoiser`] absorbs all
//! three mismatches - feed it a chunk at the hardware rate and it returns the
//! cleaned audio already resampled to [`TARGET_SAMPLE_RATE`], so it drops into
//! the capture callback in place of the plain resample.
//!
//! Samples that do not fill a whole 480-sample frame are held back and
//! prepended to the next chunk, so a frame is never zero-padded (which RNNoise
//! hears as a click). At most one frame - 10 ms - is therefore still buffered
//! when a recording ends.
