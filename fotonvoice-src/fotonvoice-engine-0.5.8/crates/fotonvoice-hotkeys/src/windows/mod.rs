//! Windows hotkey backend: a Win32 low-level keyboard hook.
//!
//! Gesture recognition is the shared engine, so `hold`, `toggle`, `double_tap`
//! and `double_tap_hold` behave exactly as they do on Linux.
//!
//! # Shape
//!
//! Three pieces, and the split between them is the design:
//!
//! * The **hook procedure** runs inside whatever process generated the
//!   keystroke, and Windows silently unhooks a procedure that takes longer than
//!   `LowLevelHooksTimeout` - capped at one second since Windows 10 1709, with
//!   no notification to the application. So it does the least possible work:
//!   resolve a key id from a pure lookup, decide suppression from lock-free
//!   arrays and a `try_read`, push onto an unbounded channel, return.
//! * The **pump thread** owns the hook. `SetWindowsHookExW` requires the
//!   installing thread to run a message loop, and the hook is only ever called
//!   on that thread.
//! * The **worker thread** does everything expensive: matching, gesture timing,
//!   binding reloads, and sending gestures to the app.
//!
//! # Privacy
//!
//! This hook is called for every keystroke on the machine. That is the same
//! exposure as the evdev and X11 backends on Linux, and unlike the XDG portal,
//! so `Backend::WindowsHook` reports `sees_raw_keys() == true` and
//! `is_private() == false`. Nothing here logs, stores or forwards a key: each
//! event is matched against the user's bindings and dropped.
