//! Global shortcuts from X11 raw key events (XInput2).
//!
//! This is the backend for the large middle ground between "the compositor
//! serves the GlobalShortcuts portal" and "the user has already given this
//! process access to input devices": X11 desktops such as Cinnamon, MATE and
//! Xfce, which have no shortcuts portal and no intention of growing one.
//!
//! XInput2 raw key events are delivered to the root window independent of which
//! window has focus, so they work as global shortcuts, and - unlike the evdev
//! fallback - **any** X client may ask for them. There is no group to join, no
//! udev rule to install, and nothing for FotonVoice Engine to change about the machine.
//! That is what makes this backend usable where the evdev one is not.
//!
//! The version this declares to the server is load-bearing: see
//! `MIN_XI_MINOR`.
//!
//! It carries the same privacy cost as evdev, though: raw events are every key
//! the user presses, not just FotonVoice Engine's own shortcuts, so it ranks below the
//! portal and the app says which one it is running on.
//!
//! Unlike the portal, this sees individual presses and releases, so every
//! gesture style works here - hold and double-tap-hold included - as do
//! bare-modifier triggers like double-tapping Super, which no accelerator-based
//! backend can express.
